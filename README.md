# SmartDice

## Summary
SmartDice generates then visualizes a tuned series of random data using JavaFX. With a Long Term Short Memory (LSTM) algorithm, a model is trained upon initialization and tries to learn any relationship between the inputs and outputs, then returns real-time forecasted time-sensitive strategies to allow users to explore probability tweaking inputs within the user interface.
