# SmartDice

## Summary
SmartDice is an open-source JavaFX application in progress that uses an object-oriented approach for a generation of data, in which case is "rolling dice" and updating user(s) profile data accordingly.
 The "Smart" aspect is to implement a user-friendly feature that uses Machine Learning (ML) to explore the realm of probability and display it in a human-interpretable manner when enabled.

- Generate a mass number of dice rounds that are labeled (ID, Timestamp, Results, etc., some examples)
- User-friendly settings for the round(s)
- View real-time stats under the results of rolling

# Future Goals
### Short-term goals
- Export data in CSV format
- Functional create, remove, sign-in, and sign-out of user profile(s)
- Simulate more than one account rolling dice
- Add more statistics that are hardcoded (ex. Linear regression)
- Add functional tabs (Dashboard. Notifications, Calendar, Settings)
- Add JavaDoc
- Clean-up code and add comments for open-source usability + JavaDocs

### Long-term goals
- Python embedded in Java
- Database infrastructure
- Toggle Smart function using ML in the background (Long Term Short Memory Algorithm)
- Looking into other models such as Generative adversarial network (GAN)
